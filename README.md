# SortExceptions
SortExceptions sorts Mozilla-compatible exceptions-lists right-to-left, so VERY useful for domain-lists.

Add*s* a button in the "cookie exceptions" management window, to sort them by the low level domains of the hostname. The SortExceptions extension allows you to organize cookie exceptions by low level domains. Note: The SortExceptions addon is cross-platform and it works on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.
